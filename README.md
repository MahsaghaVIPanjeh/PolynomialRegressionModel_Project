# PolynomialRegressionModel_Project

In this project, we have a dataset consist of 10 rows and 3 column.
This dataset demonstrate the position and their related salary.
We can predict the salary based on the position.
Because this dataset is very small so in this project, we did not split dataset into training and test set.
In this project, we used both simple linear regresson and polynomial regression to predict results and compare them.
